[Xtensor](https://xtensor.readthedocs.io/).
He obtained a Ph.D. in combinatorial optimization and machine learning from École Polytechnique
de Montréal in 2021 where he worked at the interplay of deep learning and operations research.
During that time, he developed [Ecole](https://www.ecole.ai) a mixed Python/C++ library to ease the
research on the use of machine learning methods for decision making inside mathematical solvers.
